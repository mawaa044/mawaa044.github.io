    <h1>Crypto currentcy fraud:</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">

            <h4>
                Crypto scams have dramatically increased the past couple of years or so. According to statistics over crypto fraud losses between 2018 and 2022 provided by the FTC’s consumer sentinel network, the losses to crypto scam was at its lowest in 2018 with 12 million dollars lost and at its highest in 2021 with 680 million dollars lost. The reason for this increase in crypto fraud is because crypto currency has risen in popularity the past few years. Crypto currency has recently become the hottest thing on the market, and everyone wants a piece. However, many people who want to invest in crypto don’t have experience with financial investments, and that’s the kind of people the scammers are looking for. The scammers take advantage of those people by making them make big investments in crypto with false promises of wealth and fortune for the investors. The investors are left thinking they’re riding the Crypto train up the stock-market hill, but what they don’t know is that the scammer is the only one with a ticket. The negative consequences of this are that less people are taking crypto currency seriously as a financial investment and that the stock market is greatly affected by bad investments. A positive consequence of this is that people might learn to be more careful with their money and think their investments through more thoroughly.
