                One of the most infamous scams out there is the “Nigerian prince” scam.
                This scam, as the name implies, involves a scammer claiming that he is of Nigerian royalty.
                The scammer tells his victims that he is stuck in another country and that they need to send him a large sum of money so that he can return to Nigeria.
                The scammer baits his victims with false promises of a reward if they give him the money.
                Another well-known scam is the “Microsoft” scam. How it works is that a scammer calls his victims and claims that he works for Microsoft.
             The scammer will often tell his victims that something is wrong with their computer and that Microsoft will send them insurance money.
              The scammer will then tell the victims that Microsoft has sent them too much money and that they need to send some of it back to Microsoft (often via a gift card).
               What's evil about this scam is that the scammers prey on old people who don't have much experience with the internet,
             which makes them an easy target.
