    <h1>useful advice on how to avoid scams:</h1>

            <h4>
                Internet fraud, better known as internet scams, have become infamous dangers of the world wide web. But how can you identify a scam, more importantly avoid one? You should always be on the lookout for potential scams when you’re online. Be careful when encountering suspicious emails or links. Be skeptical to emails claiming that you have won some sort of prize, if it’s too good to be true it’s most likely not. If you get a message from someone close to you asking for money or behaving strangely, consider the possibility that they may have been hacked. Look for spelling mistakes in messages you find suspicious, and always block messages from people you think are scammers.
                Internet scams are frauds often targeted towards vulnerable people online. Being critical of what you see online and taking necessary precautions against fraud is one step closer to preventing scammers from making money off innocent people. Don’t trust everything you see on the internet, and if you find yourself in a situation where you think someone is trying to trick you, just remember what you have read in this essay. I bid you farewell and good luck, dear readers.
